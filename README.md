# Hello! I'm Kirk, an Open Source Game Developer

I've been creating and publishing my own video games since late 2008 (the days of Flash lol).

Since then I've built a deep fluency developing HTML5 web games using tools such as ES6 JavaScript, CSS3, and frameworks such as PhaserJS. Outside of game dev, I have aquired skills in full stack web development, leveraging tools like ReactJS, Firebase, and many others to create incredible web experiences.

### My goal is to find a way to become financially independant, and spend my time creating amazing open source video games full-time! :shipit:
